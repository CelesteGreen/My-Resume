    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      I have always loved the creative side of my previous job. I was an Online
      Visual Merchandiser for eight years. I was self-taught in HMTL until I did
      a few Udemy Courses to sharpen my skills and broaden my knowledge. So,
      when it came to making sure everything looked amazing and in place on the
      website just by customizing the backend has always been my happy place.
      Knowing that 100s of people see your work and admire it drives me to try
      new and exciting challenges.
